#first task: Write a program that takes two numbers from the user,and outputs their sum
# first_number = input("Give me the first number")
# second_number = input("Give me the second number")
# print(f"The sum of those numbers is {int(first_number)+int(second_number)}")


#Write a program that takes two numbers from the user,and outputs the equation representing the multiplication ofthe two numbers
first_number = input("Give me the first number")
second_number = input("Give me the second number")
print(f"If you multiply {first_number} with {second_number} you get {int(first_number)*int(second_number)}")

#Write a program that takes a distance in kilometers from the user, 
# and output the distance in meters and centimeters
# distance_in_km = input("How many km?")
# print(f"Thanks! Just so you know, that equals {int(distance_in_km)*1000}m or {int(distance_in_km)*100000}cm!")

#Write a program that takes the user's name and height(in centimeters), 
#and outputs a summary sentence
# name = input("Hi! What is your name?")
# height = input("How tall are you in cm?")
# print(f"Holy! {name} you're really {height}cm tall?")
